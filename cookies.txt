  <!-- Where you want to go afterwards (Defaults back to this same page) -->
  <input type="hidden" name="return_url" value="/some/page" />
  
  <!-- the value of your cookie, must always be name="cookie_value" -->
  <label>What is your username?</label>
  <input type="text" name="cookie_value" />
  
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
